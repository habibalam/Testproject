  Prior to the advent of Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), Java 
 needed to use JavaBeans to create Web applications. Although JavaBeans 
 helped in the development of user interface (UI) components, they were not 
 able to provide services, such as transaction management and security,
  which were required for developing robust and secure enterprise 
  applications. The advent of EJB was seen as a solution to this problem 
  EJB extends the Java components, such as Web and enterprise components,
   and provides services that help in enterprise application development.
    However, developing an enterprise application with EJB was not easy, 
    as the developer needed to perform various tasks, such as creating Home
     and Remote interfaces and implementing lifecycle callback methods which 
     lead to the complexity of providing code for EJBs Due to this 
     complication, developers started
   looking for an easier way to develop enterprise applications.
